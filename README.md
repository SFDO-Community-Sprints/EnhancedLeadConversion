### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We want to add additional functionality to Lead Conversion that isn't currently available in the existing NPSP functionality. Specifically, we will be looking to add:
* The ability to map Account fields to either the Contact's direct Account or the Contact's Affiliated Account
* The ability to specify a Record Type for created Opportunities
* Hiding irrelevant fields based on selections

This additional functionality will help NPSP users who use Leads extensively.

### Project Resources
* We have created a mock-up of an ideal lead conversion screen as well as a process flow. Both of these resources are stored in the Images folder
* User Stories are captured in the Wiki

### Project Team Accomplishments
* We wrote user stories capturing the requirements. We created a mock-up and process flow.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
The changes described in the User Stories should be incorporated into the NPSP core code. The work here will need to be evaluated by the Product Owner for possible inclusion.
