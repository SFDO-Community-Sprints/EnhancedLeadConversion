### Project Name
Enhanced Lead Conversion

### Project Team
Help us give you the thanks you deserve! Please ensure that all contributing members of the team are included!
* Team Leader(s): Sarah Joseph
* GitHub Scribe(s): Josh Kidd
* List of all Contributors: Tamara Vose, Kathryn Battista

### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We want to add additional functionality to Lead Conversion that isn't currently available in the existing NPSP functionality. Specifically, we will be looking to add:
* The ability to map Account fields to either the Contact's direct Account or the Contact's Affiliated Account
* The ability to specify a Record Type for created Opportunities

This additional functionality will help NPSP users who use Leads extensively.

### Project Resources
* Indicate if there are any existing Hub Ideas, or product Issues/Bugs that you're solving for. 
* Where can we find additional information on your project? Ie. do you have supporting code in another Repo, do you have documentation in Google, your repo's Wiki, etc.? Be sure to include (or at least links to) all supporting material here. If it's not in your project Repo, it will get lost.

### Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team accomplished during the Sprint?

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
