### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We want to add additional functionality to Lead Conversion that isn't currently available in the existing NPSP functionality. Specifically, we will be looking to add:
* The ability to map Account fields to either the Contact's direct Account or the Contact's Affiliated Account
* The ability to specify a Record Type for created Opportunities
* Hiding irrelevant fields based on selections

This additional functionality will help NPSP users who use Leads extensively.

### Project Resources
* We have created a mock-up of an ideal lead conversion screen as well as a process flow. Both of these resources are stored in the Images folder
* User Stories are captured in the Wiki

### Project Team Accomplishments
* We wrote user stories capturing the requirements. We created a mock-up and process flow.

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
